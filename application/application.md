# OBD2Network software

After you complete the [hardware part](https://github.com/OBD2Network/OBD2Network/blob/main/create_hw/create_hw.md) you can proceed to the testing.

For testing, you need to download the [software tool](https://cdn.electronic.us/products/obd2network/windows/obd2network.exe) you can proceed to the testing.

To get the product key, please message Nick Svar, bialex, or ODB2Network on Discord. 

Enter the key you’ll get on both the client’s and operator’s PCs.

## Client-side: 
- Log in:

That’s all a client needs to do.

## Operator-side:
- Log in: 

![Log in](https://github.com/OBD2Network/OBD2Network/blob/main/application/login.png)
