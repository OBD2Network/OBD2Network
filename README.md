You can read [here](https://github.com/OBD2Network/OBD2Network/blob/main/create_hw/create_hw.md) about creating your hardware

If you have set the hardware, you are welcome to test it [here](https://github.com/OBD2Network/OBD2Network/blob/main/application/application.md).

The development of this project has been put on hold as our developers are currently busy with other projects.

However, we would like to offer our services to commercial users interested in purchasing custom technology for their specific requirements. 

If you are interested in such services, please do not hesitate to contact us via support@electronic.us for more information on pricing, terms, and other details.
